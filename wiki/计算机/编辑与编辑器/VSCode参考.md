### Launching from the command line

You can also run VS Code from the terminal by typing 'code' after adding it to the path:

- Launch VS Code.
- Open the **Command Palette** (⇧⌘P) and type 'shell command' to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.

- Restart the terminal for the new `$PATH` value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

> **Note:** If you still have the old `code` alias in your `.bash_profile` (or equivalent) from an early VS Code version, remove it and replace it by executing the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.
